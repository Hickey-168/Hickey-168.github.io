## Welcome to Hickey's blog

 Up to now, the user want to maintain a blog to write something that he is interesting in, so if you ever find something that is familar
to the author's idea, you can contact him by Wechat or QQ. The thought of build a blog have been a memory as I choose software engineering as my subject that I majored in since I began my college life last year.And now, I have made it.
 To begin with, I will continually update my blog and pull request my code to github, all browser are welcome to fork it and I am also willing to share my idea with you on everything I have ever mentioned while you have got some new or better suggestion and use them to promote my code. Once your advice is accpeted, I will show my truely gratitude to you.

### Career Planning

 I major in the software engineering, and if everything go against my ideal aspiration, I have to choose finding a satisfactory internship in my junior year. Considering the current employment situation, machine learning is probably the most suitble research direction for me, which means I will put my learning point mostly focusing on the Algorithm analysis and data structure. As you can see, that's not a simple mission, and until now, I can't give a certain answer that I'll be in this business, all of these are just my current thought,not my future. But what I can promise is that I will give all of myself on the things that I have always persued.

### 计算机网络

第三章：运输层
    3.1运输层为运行在不同主机上的应用进程之间提供了逻辑通信功能。
       发送端和接收都经历了报文段的转化（经由运输层改变
       运输层协议（TCP（传输控制协议）和UDP（用户数据报协议））
       TCP的运输层分组叫做报文段，UDP的运输层分组叫数据报。
    3.2将运输层报文段中的数据交付到正确的套接字的工作称为多路分解。在源主机从不同套接字中收集数据块，并为每个数据块封装上首部信息（这将在以后用于分          解）从而生成报文段，然后将报文段传递到网络层，所有这些工作称为多路复用。
       运输层多路复用的要求：1.套接字有唯一标识符  2.每个报文段有特殊字段来指示该报文段所要交付到的套接字。
       这些特殊字段是源端口号字段和目的端口号字段。（端口号16bit 故两个字段组合而成的字段为32bit）
       （比方说我们开发一个新的应用程序时，必须为其分配一个编口号）
