## Welcome to Hickey's blog

 Up to now, the user want to maintain a blog to write something that he is interesting in, so if you ever find something that is familar
to the author's idea, you can contact him by Wechat or QQ. The thought of build a blog have been a memory as I choose software engineering as my subject that I majored in since I began my college life last year.And now, I have made it.
 To begin with, I will continually update my blog and pull request my code to github, all browser are welcome to fork it and I am also willing to share my idea with you on everything I have ever mentioned while you have got some new or better suggestion and use them to promote my code. Once your advice is accpeted, I will show my truely gratitude to you.

### Career Planning

 I major in the software engineering, and if everything go against my ideal aspiration, I have to choose finding a satisfactory internship in my junior year. Considering the current employment situation, machine learning is probably the most suitble research direction for me, which means I will put my learning point mostly focusing on the Algorithm analysis and data structure. As you can see, that's not a simple mission, and until now, I can't give a certain answer that I'll be in this business, all of these are just my current thought,not my future. But what I can promise is that I will give all of myself on the things that I have always persued.
